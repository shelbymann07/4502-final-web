			<h2>The emotional recap of studying abroad</h2>
			<div class="when">
				<h3>March 3, 2015</h3>
			</div><!--when-->
			<br>
			<p><i>Note: I wrote this while in a museum in France in December 2014, so it is not recent. </i></p>

	<p>This semester was romantic. Europe encompasses the word in every sense - the architecture, the landscape, the cities, the countryside, the mountains, the ocean, the fashion, the European men to swoon over, and the ones you long for back across the ocean.</p>

	<p>This semester will forever remain in my mind as the "bubble semester." It feels as if I've been in a happy bubble for the past three and a half months. Even when "the worst" seemed to happen, good normally came as a result. I've learned how to be a happier, more accepting human being (but I've still maintained my selective cynical side - have no fear).</p>

	<p>At my core, I am still the same person. All my faults are still there, I've just become even more aware of them than I already was. I did not go through some radical metamorphism because I put myself on a different continent. I have, however, been able to step aside from the comfortable routine that was my life for the past two years, close to one of the longest durations of time in a single location for me. I became able to evaluate myself, the people in my life, the things in my life, and my future with a fresh mindset.</p>

	<p>Before I came to Europe, I was adamant my life would remain virtually the same and that nothing too terribly drastic would happen. It seemed silly that a single semester of temporarily relocating to a different country should really alter much. How could a mere three months mean a different world on the other side of that time? Not much had changed over two years, so what impact could three months bring?</p>

<p>I like to think I'm wise beyond my years, but alas, I am not. And while studying abroad does <i>not</i> have to bring major changes to anyone's world, it allows you to live your life outside of that routine and see what's worth maintaining and what's strong enough to hold once that routine is broken.</p>

<p>Frankly, while the past few months have brought changes that may linger on the brink of "major" to me, they'll have a zero to completely irrelevant impact on the rest of the human race.</p>

<p>If there's one thing I've learned, it's to embrace change with open arms and a warm hug. Because hugs are nice. Adapting has become a necessary skill in my life, but for whatever reason I feared coming back to a changed Columbia wayyy more than I should have.</p>

<p>I have become so much more accepting of myself and other things and I'm not afraid to embrace things I might not have embraced before. And that's really helped me appreciate some things I wouldn't have appreciated in the past.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It’s been another two months or so since I first wrote this. Yes, Columbia was incredibly different on my return. No, it wasn’t (isn't) perfect. All aspects of change, obviously, require some level of acclimating and adjusting yourself. And while there are still some battles of change I feel like I’m fighting head-on, I’m okay. I have those days where I wish everything could just go back to how it used to be, but then I force myself to look at where I am now, how I’ve grown as a person, and how where I want to be in the future has changed. And that makes it all worth it. Because, at least for today, I <i>will</i> be back in Europe with a job, I <i>will </i>accomplish the lofty goals I have in place, I <i>will</i> recognize everything has happened as it’s supposed to. And as far as I’m concerned, I wouldn’t have been able to accomplish any of that if I had four years of routine continuity in college.</p>
		

<h2>The Questions Project: Colette Rector</h2>
			<div class="when">
				<h3>April 27, 2015</h3>
			</div><!--when-->
			<br>	
	
	<p>Colette Rector is a junior at Mizzou studying strategic communication and Spanish. She's quite certainly one of the cleverest, if not the most clever, person I know. She hails from Homaha, Neb., and will happily tell you everything you need to know about it. She is currently one of my roommates. And as you'll learn, I apparently need to lock up my food, and she absolute <em>adores</em> my daily briefings where I discuss in vivid detail, with in-depth analysis, all of my dreams from the previous night.

<p>Without further ado: <del>Collette Collete</del> Colette.


<p>1. <i>What was the last picture you took with your phone?</i></p>
<p>Me trying to be aesthetic, artsy and h!p.

<a href="https://shelbymann.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/colette-e1429556493692.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2163" src="https://shelbymann.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/colette-e1429556493692.jpg?w=660" alt="Picture taken by Colette Rector." width="660" height="495" /></a> 
<br>
<br>
<p>2. <i>Have you ever been pulled over by a cop?</i></p>
<p>One time before a high school jazz band rehearsal, I drove five minutes to purchase a giant frosted sugar cookie. On the way back, I “sped” in a school zone and they zapped me. I almost cried.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>3. What’s your heritage?</p>
<p>Half Italian, half European mut.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>4. <i>What was the last lie you told?</i></p>
<p>I told myself I’d be productive today.</p>
<br><br>
<p>5. <i>What’s the weirdest prank you’ve ever done?</i></p>
<p>Ninth grade Colette was a maniacal freak. I wrote fake love letters to one of my friends under the pseudonym Ann Onymous and sent them via email. Every letter was written in Curlz MT and I signed them “The Damsel.” Here’s a sample line:
<em>“Your beautiful, angel-touched face floods my dreams at night and your radiant smile gives me a light no sun could ever produce.”</em></p>
<br><br>
<p>6. <i>Describe the perfect pizza.</i></p>
<p>Thin crust. A dash of olive oil in lieu of sauce. Enough garlic to still be tasted after two teeth-brushing sessions. Approximately ⅓ an inch of mozzarella. Fresh mushrooms. Spices I can’t name but like. Baked in a brick oven by a dark-haired dreamboat and followed by a slice of cheesecake.</p>
<br>
<p>7. <i>What was your first thought when you woke up this morning? </i></p>
<p>ASLKDJFAS;LDKFJAWEURFDVBNVM,ADSBFGHEwtalj.</p>
<br>
<p>8. <i>You discover that your wonderful one-year-old child is because of a mix up at the hospital and not yours. Would you want to exchange the child to correct the mistake?</i></p>
<p>To quote the ancient Chinese proverb, “you get what you get and you don’t throw a fit.”</p>
<br>
<p>9. <i>Would you be willing to lie to a court for a close friend if it meant saving your friend from going to prison for life?</i></p>
<p>Anyone who has ever played Poker or Avalon with me knows that I can only keep a straight face to an extent. Close friends be warned: if you willfully mutilate another human being, you’re on your own.</p>
<br>
<p>10. <i>Would you be willing to eat a bowl of crickets for money?</i></p>
<p>This question is impossibly ambiguous. Would I climb into the sky for fame? Would I skinny dip in front of my elementary school principal for knowledge? Would I fall into the world of Calvin and Hobbes and remain a cartoon forever in exchange for true love? I don’t feel prepared to reasonably answer.</p>
<br>
<p>11. <i>If you could have anyone locked in a room so you could torment them for a day, whom would you choose?</i></p>
<p>Dolores Umbridge, but I’m gonna need more than a day.</p>
<br>
<p>12. <i>If you could be any age for a week, what age would you be?</i></p>
<p>Like, if I had the mental faculties that I have now? Definitely age negative one month.</p>
<br>
<p>13. <i>What question do you hate being asked?</i></p>
<p>Do you want to hear about this dream I had last night? Yeah totally, spend ten minutes of my time explaining this “hilarious” journey through your subconscious that has no merit or broader impact on anything real ever.</p>
<br>
<p>14. <i>If you could have only one meal for the rest of your life, what would it be?</i></p>
<p>A Chinese buffet that also has every other kind of food ever.</p>
<br>
<p>15. <i>Have you ever eaten a crayon? What’s the strangest thing you’ve eaten?</i></p>
<p>I can’t recall eating a crayon, but when I was in second grade I licked battery acid off a battery. I could try and explain why that seemed like the logical thing to do, but you would still leave with more questions than answers.</p>
<br>
<p>16. <i>Are you still learning who you are?</i></p>
<p>No, I can perfectly predict how I will respond to any and every life circumstance thrown at me and milk these responses to achieve maximum happiness levels.</p>
<br>
<p>17. <i>What’re you afraid of?</i></p>
<p>Running out of groceries. Loneliness. People that look put together every single day. Living life more concerned with my reputation than my impact. Bad smells.</p>
<br>
<p>18.<i>What’s the weirdest thing about you?</i></p>
<p>A lot of people over the years have told me that I’m weird. Not in a side-eye, judgmental way, but in a good way. I believe everyone is inherently strange and that strangeness manifests itself differently for each person and I think that the reason people think I’m weird is because I celebrate those quirky things rather than hide them under a mask of normalcy. That being said, I’ll say that the weirdest thing about me is that I don’t care if people think I’m weird.</p>
<br>
<p>19. <i>What’s the most normal thing about you?</i></p>
<p>Sometimes I eat my roommates’ food.</p>
<br>
<p>20. <i>What are your thoughts on honesty?</i></p>
<p>It’s really hard because we as members of the human race suck at life sometimes and we like to pretend that we don’t.</p>
<br>
<p>21. <i>What do you want your tombstone to say?</i></p>
<p>“Go eat peanut butter because I can’t anymore.”</p>
<br>
<p>22. <i>What feels like love to you?</i></p>
<p>Disbelief that I could be so lucky.</p>
<br>
<p>23. <i>What’s a skill you’d like to learn and why?</i></p>
<p>I’d like to be a low key piano master.</p>
<br>
<p>24. <i>How would your friends describe you?</i></p>
<p>“Bad at texting.”
“One time she offered a stranger at a movie theatre a dollar for a handful of popcorn.”
“Her name has one L.” &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
“Has strong opinions about lots of things, like how to eat a donut and cats.”
“Grocery shopping with her is more of an experience than an errand.”
“Geriatric as f*dge.”</p>
